## Journey
### Early Life
I am originally from the district of Leribe in Lesotho, born in a small town called Peka. A few years later, I moved to Maputsoe, another town within the same district, mainly for educational reasons. Throughout my early years, I changed schools several times, which meant relocating to different places more than once. These moves shaped much of my childhood and exposed me to different environments, people, and learning experiences. I currently live at Maseru, Ha - Abia and i am a student at Botho University.

### How it Started
My journey into software development began in an unexpected way. At first, it was more of a joke — I was fascinated by how movies showed people building incredible tech and controlling systems with just a keyboard. That curiosity sparked something real in me. I started exploring the world of software, and what began as a light interest quickly grew into a true passion.

Since i got an opportunity to study it, I've developed a strong appreciation for how powerful software can be in solving real-life problems. I enjoy the challenge of building systems from scratch, whether it's designing interfaces, managing backend logic, or working with databases. I’ve worked on projects ranging from web applications to system automation and continue to sharpen my skills every day.
 
### Goals
I’m currently an intern at Africa Code Academy, where I’m focused on strengthening my software development skills. This opportunity allows me to apply what I’ve learned, explore new technologies, and grow through hands-on experience. I’m excited to keep learning and improving as I build real-world projects.

One of my biggest inspirations is a successful entrepreneur named Jeff, who runs a thriving internet café and uses it as a platform to educate and uplift others interested in tech. Watching his journey sparked something in me — a desire not just to grow in the tech world, but to use my knowledge to empower others too.

My main goal is to become a confident and skilled software developer, someone who can build real solutions and take on challenges with creativity and clarity. But I’m not stopping there — I also dream of starting my own business, beginning with an internet café that can serve as both a hub for access and a space for learning.

I’m eager to keep exploring and growing, which is why I also plan to study other fields. I'm open to discovering what else is out there, broadening my knowledge, and seeing how different areas can connect with my love for technology.
